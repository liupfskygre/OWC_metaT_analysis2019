# this is a markdown file for the mapping of OWC-metaT2018 from JGI to references

1. to owc deRep 89 Methanogens MAGs (==>transcripts recruit to genomes)
2. to DRAM annotated genes (==>gene/pathway expression)
3. to all dereplicated OWC  mcrA (from contigs,==>transcripts to mcrA/methanogens )

## download metaT from JGI, 109 samples
